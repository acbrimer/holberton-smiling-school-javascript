# holberton-smiling-school-javascript

A project for Holberton School web specializations.

## About

This is a fake site based on a set of Figma templates created by Holberton. This project extends an existing HTML/CSS-only implementation of these templates (found [here](https://github.com/acbrimer/holberton-smiling-school)) with some JavaScript. This is far from my first rodeo working with JS, but will be a fun challenge to complete without the cozy Typescipt/React environments I've been spoiled in getting used to.

## Requirements

- Project structure
  - You have to use Bootstrap
  - Your styles.css must be as small as you can - you must use as much as you can Bootstrap classes
  - You have to use JQuery
